# **Reflection**

## **Difficulties Encountered**
- *22127014*: For me, the most significant challenge was drawing conclusions or hypotheses from the visualized charts and data. Being able to interpret a chart does not necessarily mean one can formulate realistic hypotheses based on it.
- *22127170*: From my perspective, I found it difficult to identify and address meaningful questions for the entire dataset, while ensuring that these questions aligned with the project goals and provided valuable insights. Additionally, time management was also a significant obstacle, as balancing different phases like data collection, preprocessing, exploration, and analysis was required more effort than expected.

## **Lessons Learned**
- *22127014*: I learned to apply the skills I've studied in class to my project. I also developed my ability to organize and schedule tasks and workloads effectively.
- *22127170*: Through the process of completing the project, I learned how to analyze and extract insights from raw datasets effectively. I also gained valuable experience in managing my time efficient for each phase of the project.

## **Future Improvements**
If our group had more time, we would have liked to delve deeper into the dataset to uncover more insights and scrape more data from different sources to enrich the dataset cause we think it would be more interesting and informative. Furthermore, we would like to use various machine learning algorithms to predict the number of cases in the future.
