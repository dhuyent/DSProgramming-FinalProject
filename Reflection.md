# **Reflection**

## **Difficulties Encountered**
- *22127008*: In general, my personal difficulties are also the common difficulties of the whole group that need to be considered to be able to solve in the best way. The first difficulty is finding a data set that meets the general requirements. Learning and understanding the selected data set to be able to analyze the data effectively, needing to clearly understand the origin, structure and meaning of the data is also one of the difficulties in the process of implementing this project.
- *22127014*: For me, the most significant challenge was drawing conclusions or hypotheses from the visualized charts and data. Being able to interpret a chart does not necessarily mean one can formulate realistic hypotheses based on it.
- *22127170*: From my perspective, I found it difficult to identify and address meaningful questions for the entire dataset, while ensuring that these questions aligned with the project goals and provided valuable insights. Additionally, time management was also a significant obstacle, as balancing different phases like data collection, preprocessing, exploration, and analysis was required more effort than expected.

## **Lessons Learned**
- *22127008*: From those difficulties, plus learning the tools and techniques learned in class, I have clearly understood how to exploit data and use them appropriately to be able to analyze and interpret the results accurately.
- *22127014*: I learned to apply the skills I've studied in class to my project. I also developed my ability to organize and schedule tasks and workloads effectively.
- *22127170*: Through the process of completing the project, I learned how to analyze and extract insights from raw datasets effectively. I also gained valuable experience in managing my time efficiently for each phase of the project.

## **Future Improvements**
If our group had more time, we would have liked to delve deeper into the dataset to uncover more insights and scrape more data from different sources to enrich the dataset cause we think it would be more interesting and informative. Furthermore, we would like to use various machine learning algorithms to predict the number of cases in the future.
