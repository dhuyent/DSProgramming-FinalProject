# **Reflection**

## **Difficulties Encountered**
- *22127014*: For me, the most significant challenge was drawing conclusions or hypotheses from the visualized charts and data. Being able to interpret a chart does not necessarily mean one can formulate realistic hypotheses based on it.

## **Lessons Learned**
- *22127014*: I learned to apply the skills I've studied in class to my project. I also developed my ability to organize and schedule tasks and workloads effectively.

## **Future Improvements**
If our group had more time, we would have liked to delve deeper into the dataset to uncover more insights and scrape more data from different sources to enrich the dataset cause we think it would be more interesting and informative. Furthermore, we would like to use various machine learning algorithms to predict the number of cases in the future.
